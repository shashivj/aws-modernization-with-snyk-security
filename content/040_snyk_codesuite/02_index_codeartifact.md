## Architecture
![Snyk CodeArtifact Architecture](/images/snyk-codeartifact-architecture.png "architeture")

## Prerequisites
1. Have a AWS CLI configured with admin permission to create resources and launch the CDK stack
2. Have AWS git-remote-codecommit setup with your account to be able to interact with the CodeCommit repository in your account
3. Have Snyk token and Snyk Org ID available to you on AWS SSM Parameter store in your AWS account

## Setting up the environment
### 1. Creating AWS CodeCommit repository
Before starting this section, make sure you have a CodeCommit repository created in your AWS account. Once the CodeCommit repository is created, we will be commiting two scripts needed for the build environment to create a `requirements.txt`. These scripts are located `here`

To create a new CodeCommit repository using AWS CLI , run the following command.
> Ensure you have `codecommit:CreateRepository` permission for your user profile

```bash
aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name SnykCodeArtifactRepo --repository-description "Snyk CodeArtifact repo"
```
Once the repository is successfully created you will see a message like the one below
```json
{
    "repositoryMetadata": {
        "accountId": "112233445566",
        "repositoryId": "c4721f38-61c2-4143-8a64-d46486deea1b",
        "repositoryName": "SnykCodeArtifactRepo",
        "repositoryDescription": "Snyk CodeArtifact repo",
        "lastModifiedDate": 1620395170.604,
        "creationDate": 1620395170.604,
        "cloneUrlHttp": "https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/SnykCodeArtifactRepo",
        "cloneUrlSsh": "ssh://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/SnykCodeArtifactRepo",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-1:112233445566:SnykCodeArtifactRepo"
    }
}
```
Copy the `Arn`, and `cloneUrlHttp` fields in a separate place for usage later in the deployment stage
### 2. Creating AWS CodeArtifact Domain and Repository
To Create a new CodeArtifact Domain and repository using CLI, run the following commands:

```bash
aws codeartifact create-domain --domain demo-domain
```
Note that the `--domain` must be numbers & lowercase letters only. You should see a message like below on a successful creation:

```json
{
    "domain": {
        "name": "demo-domain",
        "owner": "112233445566",
        "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-east-1:112233445566:domain/demo-domain",
        "status": "Active",
        "createdTime": 1620397725.902,
        "encryptionKey": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:112233445566:key/72224f64-5f1e-4a16-ac69-398ff25b8617",
        "repositoryCount": 0,
        "assetSizeBytes": 0,
        "s3BucketArn": "arn:aws:s3:::assets-193858265520-us-east-1"
    }
}
```
Note down the `name` & `owner` from the response as these will be used in the deployment stage.

Now that the domain is created, you can create a repository within that domain. Run the following:

```bash
aws codeartifact create-repository --domain demo-domain --repository pypi-store
```

The above command should return a response like below
```json
{
    "repository": {
        "name": "pypi-store",
        "administratorAccount": "112233445566",
        "domainName": "demo-domain",
        "domainOwner": "112233445566",
        "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-east-1:112233445566:repository/demo-domain/pypi-store",
        "upstreams": [],
        "externalConnections": []
    }
}
```
### 3. Associating CodeArtifact domain with external connection
The next step is associating the repository with an external connection. There are several external repositories available as external connections, but for this workshop we will be utilizing the Python Package Index `public:pypi`. To add this external connection run:
```bash
aws codeartifact associate-external-connection --external-connection public:pypi \
    --domain demo-domain --domain-owner 112233445566 --repository pypi-store
```
Which should return a response like below:
```json
{
    "repository": {
        "name": "pypi-store",
        "administratorAccount": "112233445566",
        "domainName": "demo-domain",
        "domainOwner": "112233445566",
        "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-east-1:112233445566:repository/demo-domain/pypi-store",
        "upstreams": [],
        "externalConnections": [
            {
                "externalConnectionName": "public:pypi",
                "packageFormat": "pypi",
                "status": "AVAILABLE"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
This repository created will be the source for the Codepipeline that runs the Snyk CodeArtifact scan. The CodePipeline triggers daily and builds a `requirements.txt` file by listing the packages in CodeArtifact domain.

### 4. Populating the new repository
Now that your codeartifact repository has been set up. You need to configure your cli to pull packages using it. To do this, log into the AWS Management Console and navigate to CodeArtifact and locate your repository
![Snyk CodeArtifact Repo](/images/codeartifact-repodetails.png "repo")

Click on the `View connection instructions` button and copy down the connection instructtions listed for pip as the package manager

![Snyk CodeArtifact Pip](/images/codeartifact-connection.png "pip-connection")

In order to preserve your current python environment, create a local virtual virtual environment for python.
To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:
```
$ python3 -m venv .env
```
After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following step to activate your virtualenv.
```
$ source .env/bin/activate
```
If youre on a windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:
```
% .env\Scripts\activate.bat
```
Once the virtualenv is activated, you can then install dependencies with pip. Log in to the codeartifact repository with the command copied from the console in the above steps
```bash
code aws codeartifact login --tool pip --repository pypi-store --domain demo-domain --domain-owner 112233445566
```
You should receive the response:
```
Successfully configured pip to use AWS CodeArtifact repository https://demo-domain-112233445566.d.codeartifact.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pypi/pypi-store/
Login expires in 12 hours at 2021-05-07 23:58:57-04:00
```
With the repository configured, run ```bash pip install aws-cdk.core``` to pull down some packages into the repository. If you navigate back into the CodeArtifact console, you will see that there are now multiple packages in the repository

### 2. Setting up CDK

> Refer to CDK setup section (TODO)

## Deployment
> How to stage the scripts for workshop readers to get for their repo
Once the repository has been created, 2 scripts have to be uploaded to the repo prior to kicking off the deployment of the CDK stack.

## Checking results in S3
After the CodePipeline successfully runs and the build job is completed you should have results in the output section of the S3 bucket as well as in the Snyk Console. Let's start with the S3 ouput as this is the raw build output. Under the bucket created in the stack which can be found in the resources section of the Cloudformation stack, navigate to the ```artifactbucket\outputs\``` subfolder and locate the folder that matches the date & time of the last build project that ran. The build outputs two files, one with the requirements.txt file generated from the AWS CodeArtifact domain and the other a list of packages which could not successfully be installed by pip and therefore unable to be scanned by the Snyk CLI (These packages can be analyzed for incompatibilities such as python versions etc.)

![Snyk S3 Path Structure](/images/s3_scan_out.png "s3")

## Checking results in Snyk
After the build successfully runs, the [Snyk console](https://www.snyk.io) will generate a project with the name provided in the CDK definition during deployment. Navigate to the project in the the Snyk Console by clicking on it.

![Snyk Dashboard](/images/codeartifact_scan_dash.png "dash")

The project page will give you an overview of all the CodeArtifact domain including all the Dependencies, Issues(Both Vulnerability & License) as well as remediation informations for the vulnerabilities with a published fix.

![Snyk Dependency Tree](/images/snyk_dependency_tree.png "deps")

## Cleanup

As this lab creates resources which will accrue cost if not deleted, please run the following commands to cleanup the resources in this lab.

```bash
cdk destroy
```

After the CDK stack has been destroyed, move onto deleting the CodeCommit repository using AWS CLI command

```bash
aws codecommit delete-repository --repository-name SnykCodeArtifactRepo
```

Finaly we can delete the CodeArtifact Domain & Repository created

```bash
aws codeartifact delete-repository --repository-name SnykCodeArtifactRepo --domain demo-domain
```


```bash
aws codeartifact delete-domain --domain demo-domain
```
